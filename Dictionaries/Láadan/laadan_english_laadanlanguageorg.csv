doroledim,(sublimation with food accompanied by guilt about that sublimation) This word has no English equivalent whatsoever. Say you have an average woman. She has no control over her life. She has little or nothing in the way of a resource for being good to herself; even when it is necessary. She has family and animals and friends and associates that depend on her for sustenance of all kinds. She rarely has adequate sleep or rest; she has no time for herself; no space of her own; little or no money to buy things for herself; no opportunity to consider her own emotional needs. She is at the beck and call of others; because she has these responsibilities and obligations and does not choose to (or cannot) abandon them. For such a woman; the one and only thing she is likely to have a little control over for indulging her own self is FOOD. When such a woman overeats; the verb for that is doroledim. (And then she feels guilty; because there are women whose children are starving and who do not have even THAT option for self-indulgence... )

LAadan embeds one statement in another by putting the morpheme '-hE' on the last word of the embedded statement. So in sentence #7 the statement 'radezhehul thod Aabeth' -- 'writing a book is very hard' is marked as an embedded statement by adding '-hE' to 'Aabeth.'

lée-,meta-
lh- or -lh or -lh-,bad (intentionally) <infix> The pejorative element lh can always be added to a word to give it a negative connotation; so long as it precedes or follows a vowel and does not violate the rules of the Laadan sound system by creating a forbidden cluster. The addition of lh need not create an actual new word; for example; awith  means baby-to use instead lhawith (or awithelh) means only something like the darned baby and is ordinarily a temporary addition. But it is very handy indeed. We are indebted to the Navajo language for this device.

wo-,changes a verb to an adjective; must be put on both verb and noun; after plural marker (beautiful woman = woháya wowith) Láadan has a form that is much like an English adjective + noun sequence; as in green tree or small child. You can take any sequence of verb and subject (remembering that adjectives are only ordinary verbs in Láadan) and but the marker wo- at the beginning of each one. Beautiful woman is thus woháya wowith. This is very useful; but it is a bit different from English; because it can only be used if you have just one verb. You cannot use this pattern to translate an English sequence like little red brick wall. To make your descriptive phrase plural; you would put the plural marker me- at the beginning of the verb; as always. Busy dragons would be mewoshOod wohOowamid.
