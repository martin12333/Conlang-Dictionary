Overview / License
The purpose of the ESPDIC project is to create an electronic Esperanto-English dictionary in the form of a single Unicode (UTF8) text file with the following format :

"Esperanto : English" 

(i.e. Esperanto entry, space, colon, space, English definition - one entry per line). In some cases, a semicolon is used to show different definitions for Esperanto homonyms, e.g. "kajo : conjunction; quay, wharf". This simple formatting is designed to facilitate the integration of ESPDIC into other applications (which is highly encouraged).
