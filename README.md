# Conlang-Dictionary

I would like to make a dictionary that has translations to various conlangs

## Dictionaries

I've pulled several dictionaries from various sources, and they're in the dictionaries folder.

A script to parse each type would have to be written, but before that happens a format needs to be decided on for the compiled dictionary.

## Compiled dictionary

### Languages included

* Esperanto
* Ido
* Interlingua
* Láadan
* Solresol
* Toki Pona
* Volapük

Point me towards other conlang dicts (Lojban, Ithkuil), preferably in a relatively parsable format, if you want to see more.

I don't understand Lojban, so someone else may need to help out with this language.
